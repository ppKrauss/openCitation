## Extracts and interpretations

The Icelandic "Information law" of 2012 has an article (article 30) on reuse of public sector information, here it is translated by me:

> Article 30. Generic terms for reuse of public sector information.
> It is allowed to reuse public sector information which has been made accessible to the general public according to law, as long as the these conditions are followed:
>   1. Reuse of the information cannot violate other laws, including criminal law, copyright law and law about privacy laws, nor the rights of a third party.
>   2. Source of the information shall be attributed.
>   3. It shall be clear who is responsible for processing the information when it is made accessible to others.

Comments from [@tryggvib](https://github.com/okfn/opendatacensus/issues/555#issuecomment-123052750):

These are the general terms in Iceland for all public sector information that has been made available. Of these I have discussed the explicit mention of copyright law in the first item of the list which in my opinion can cause confusion, but lawyers I've discussed this with say that these terms apply to both the public entity as well as the user and that the first item is supposedly aimed at the public entities who should not violate copyright when they make their own information available. I don't really see how they can do that which is why I'm more inclined to interpret this as being aimed at the general public.


## Conclusion

The default *"inferred license"* of Iceland law-documents is similar to [**CC-BY**](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode).
